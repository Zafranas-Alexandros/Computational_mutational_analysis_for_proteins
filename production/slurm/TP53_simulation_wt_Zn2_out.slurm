Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 303.15 K

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.428 nm between atom 1004 and 1012

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 303.15 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.237 nm, buffer size 0.037 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.200 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
